                I did my internship at National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu,
                Taiwan (ROC ) presently working on finding and analysing motifs
                in time series data at Advanced Database Systems Lab (ADSL)
                headed by Prof. WenChih Peng, Director, Institute of Multimedia
                Engineering, Department of Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                My voyage started around October, I don't particularly remember
                how but I started searching for professors across the world
                researching in data science (at this time I searched only 5). I
                sent mails to them that I am willing to work under them in the
                coming summer, and when they didn't reply I lost my enthusiasm
                and stalled this till the end of winter vacation (A grave
                mistake). During the winter vacation, my mother was over excited
                to see me work overseas and her enthusiasm got me and I again
                started mailing professors, most of them didn‟t reply, some
                replied that I was late for the application, some replied
                positively that I can come to their labs and work but as I was
                late I couldn't get any financial help from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amongst these positive replies, one was of Prof. Wen-Chih Peng,
                people who are close to me would know how much I obsess over the
                South Asian countries and definitely I was head over heels when
                I got his reply.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting to Prof. Peng is another spin-off to the story, I mailed
                a professor at NCTU, but the professor I mailed (Dr. Yih-Lang
                Li) who was kind enough to introduce me to his good friend
                (Prof. Wen-Chih Peng) and then Prof. Peng was having some doubts
                about me coming to Taiwan but I persistently kept mailing about
                my determination to come to which he agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is how I got an offer of unpaid internship at NCTU (Unpaid
                Internship is definitely less good than paid but wait till the
                end... Unpaid Internship aren't so bad).
            </p>
            <p>
                After accepting, Prof. Peng introduced me to Office of
                International Affairs who handle the formalities of
                International Exchange Student. Through them, I got to know
                various documents I have to prepare for a visa for 2 months as a
                student not a tourist. I received from them an official
                acceptance letter from the university, a letter of approval from
                their ministry of education and then I proceeded with the Visa
                and air tickets.

                Taiwan has Taiwanese welcoming, a different touch all people are
                the kind and honest together. warmest, of all nationalities‟
                people I have ever met ( I have met people from a lot of
                nationalities, not all but all major whether Asian, European,
                American, African... not quite African but others yes ). The
                people at university speak good English not fluent still you can
                expect most of them to know and speak and there's always a
                European Guy in the lab doing his master's or doctorate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Food tips, keep your choices aside, if you go to a place that's
                a not a travel checklist of an Indian, you will have serious
                problem finding Indian Cuisine. But as Indians are all over the
                world you can find Indian Cuisine which is rare, my suggestion
                in this case will be try to explore near you to get a food
                that's not Indian but surely fits your taste buds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taiwanese people are big foodies and nutritionist as they always
                have something to drink like tea, juice, beer. Yeah, people
                drink here but you won't find anyone drunk because they know
                their limit unlike The Indians whom I found vomiting in the
                streets while roaming late night.
            </p>

                The reason for me to tell you this is survival comes first even
                before your work, if you can't survive, you can't work. About my
                work experience, I'll share the general idea but if anyone likes
                me to go to the specifics, the options to contact me is always
                open (If you want a face to face conversation make sure you are
                free for an hour or two. I have a lot to share). About the work
                experience, thankfully, I have experiences of NCTU and of IITs
                (I have met and befriended a lot of friends from Kharagpur and
                some from Delhi).
            </p>
            <p>
                About NCTU, well the university has two campuses Bo-Ai and
                Kuangfu and in between lies another university NTHU (All the
                people I have met and experienced, said that NTHU has the best
                library in Taiwan, it feels it's not a library but a five star
                hotel itself) You just will want to live there, they have
                everything but books. NCTU's library on the other hand is heaven
                for academicians here, 7 floors of books, articles,
                publications, journals etc. and a floor of audio-audio-video
                where you can find anything except study videos, but name any
                Hollywood movie, anime, tv series, they have it all. The
                lectures, well the lectures I visited were Chinese and I mainly
                focused on slides, but my lab mates said that they have English
                courses and I could've visited one if I came a bit early.
            </p>
            <p>
                The culture of study is a lot different here. With that, the
                people who were kind and patient enough to read all through
                this. A tip for going overseas, if you require stipend and
                funding try between SeptemberNovember, if you require unpaid try
                between December & February
