      <p>
        Honeywell is a conglomerate with expertise in various divisions
        like aerospace, electronics and information technology.
        Honeywell Automation is the Indian division catering to
        automating the industry and domestic housing. It develops
        products and provides process solutions, industrial automation
        processes, hospitality and room automation solutions to name a
        few.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was posted in Pune, Maharashtra which is the centre of
        operations of Honeywell Automation in India. Honeywell has its
        software development headquarters in Bengaluru, Karnataka which
        is known as Honeywell Technology Solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The automation division in Pune deals with Internet of Things
        (IoT) in general. The products and solutions incorporate IoT as
        their fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I applied through their careers portal and was shortlisted among
        thousands of candidates all across the world. After this,
        subsequent interviews were conducted over telephonic
        conversation. Interviews comprised of technical and HR rounds.
        Finally,I was selected for the internship.
      </p>
      <p>
        between December-February. 9 Based on my CV and interviews, I
        was placed in the INNCOM by Honeywell team. This team involved
        working with the hospitality industry which included luxurious
        hotels and properties. During my tenure, I was assigned to two
        prestigious projects. One of them was working for the Armani
        Hotel situated in Burj Khalifa, Dubai. The second project was
        working with Amazon‟s Alexa virtual assistant. We used to
        develop it to interact with Honeywell‟s devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, it was a great exposure which I received there on how
        the industry functions. Loyalty towards your work is what I
        learned there. One has to be dedicated to his work to climb up
        the ladder and standout of the crowd. You have to keep updating
        yourself with latest technologies which come up every day to
        survive in the industry. I used to work with enthusiasm and
        dedication which impressed my manager and his superiors who were
        based in US.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, I would like to say that everyone should try for
        internships after second year for gaining in hand experience of
        working in the industry. If you have any queries or want to know
        more about the internship, feel free to contact me. I will be
        delighted to talk to you.
